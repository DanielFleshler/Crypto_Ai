## What Was Fixed?

### Bug #1: Stop Loss Too Wide (BUG-SL-001, BUG-SL-002)
**Problem:**
- Used nearest swing point with NO buffer
- No maximum distance limit
- Could result in 5%+ stop loss in trending markets

**Fix:**
- Added 0.3% buffer beyond swing point
- Capped maximum stop loss at 1.5%
- Prevents excessive risk per trade

**Impact:**
- More consistent risk per trade
- Fewer "blown out" trades
- Better risk-adjusted returns

### Bug #2: Take Profit Too Tight (BUG-TP-001)
**Problem:**
- Used nearest swing point with no minimum
- Could result in 1% take profit in ranging markets
- Poor risk/reward ratios

**Fix:**
- Enforced minimum 2.5% take profit distance
- Searches for adequate swing points beyond minimum
- Falls back to minimum distance if no structure found

**Impact:**
- Larger average wins
- Better profit factor
- Improved risk/reward ratios

### Bug #3: Inconsistent R:R Validation (BUG-RR-001 to BUG-RR-005)
**Problem:**
- Hardcoded minimum R:R of 3.0 (too strict)
- Configuration had 1.5 (too loose)
- Mismatch between code and config

**Fix:**
- Updated config to 2.0 (balanced)
- Made all entry types use config value
- Consistent validation across all 5 entry types

**Impact:**
- More realistic signal generation
- Better balance between quality and quantity
- Consistent behavior across all entry types

---

## Files Modified

1. **`trading_strategy/ict_entries.py`** (Main fixes)
   - Fixed stop loss calculation (lines 847-926)
   - Fixed take profit calculation (lines 726-820)
   - Fixed R:R validation (5 entry types)

2. **`trading_strategy/config_loader.py`** (Config support)
   - Added `minimum_rr_ratio` to RiskManagementConfig
   - Updated get_risk_management_config()

3. **`config/trading_config.yaml`** (Configuration)
   - Updated `minimum_rr_ratio` from 1.5 to 2.0

4. **`scripts/diagnostics/diagnose_risk_reward.py`** (New diagnostic tool)
   - Created diagnostic script for future R:R analysis
